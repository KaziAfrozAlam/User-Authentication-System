# Simple C Registration and Login System

This is a basic **C** program that implements a simple registration and login system. It allows users to register with a unique username, password, email, and phone number. The system also includes basic login functionality with username and password validation.

## Features

- **User Registration:**
  - Ensures each user has a unique username.
  - Passwords, email, and phone number are stored securely.
  - A simple verification system using a placeholder function (`send_verification_code`).

- **User Login:**
  - Checks user credentials against registered users.
  - Allows for up to 3 login attempts before locking out the user.

## Code Structure

The project is made up of a single source file:

- **source.c**: Contains the main program logic, user registration, and login functionality.

### Main Functions

- **register_user()**: Handles user registration. It ensures a unique username and stores the user details in memory. Also includes a placeholder for verification code handling.
- **login()**: Allows users to log in by validating their credentials (username and password) against previously registered users.
- **valid_username()**: Checks if the entered username already exists.
- **valid_credentials()**: Verifies if the provided username and password match any registered user.
- **send_verification_code()**: Placeholder function to simulate sending a verification code to the user's email and phone.
- **valid_verification_code()**: Placeholder function to validate a user's verification code.
